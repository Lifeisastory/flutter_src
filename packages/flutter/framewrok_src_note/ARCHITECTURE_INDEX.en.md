## Risks And Unknowns
- `painting-submodules` | detailed internal boundaries inside `packages/flutter/lib/src/painting` were not expanded file-by-file | `packages/flutter/lib/src/painting/binding.dart`
- `semantics-submodules` | semantics layer was mapped structurally but not expanded beyond top-level role | `packages/flutter/lib/src/semantics/semantics.dart`
- `physics-submodules` | physics role is inferred mainly from naming and package position, not deep file inspection | `packages/flutter/lib/src/physics/*`
- `platform-facade-mapping` | `_io`/`_web` split files were identified as platform facades, but full facade-to-caller mapping was not expanded | `packages/flutter/lib/src/foundation/_platform_io.dart`
- `function-level-call-graph` | large hubs such as `framework.dart` and `object.dart` were analyzed at type-and-flow level, not full method graph level | `packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/framework.dart`
